This simple pasta showcases the best of summer tomatoes. Use the ripest, most flavorful tomatoes you can find - it makes all the difference. Cherry or grape tomatoes work wonderfully too, just halve them before cooking.

For a protein boost, add grilled chicken or shrimp. For a vegan version, skip the butter and Parmesan, or use vegan alternatives.
