These classic chocolate chip cookies are perfect for any occasion. The key to getting that perfect texture is not over-mixing the dough and pulling them from the oven when they're just barely golden - they'll continue to cook on the hot pan.

For extra gooey cookies, slightly underbake them. For crispier cookies, bake an extra minute or two.
